## üèóÔ∏è Install

This repository have binary file.

Just install it to your system with,

```shell
$ sudo make install
```

After installation complete, default st binary location is on **/usr/local/bin/st**.

I prefer using those location because every binary program that I compile by my self should be on user location.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Via config.h

[config.h](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bandithijo/st-bandithijo/master/config.h)

Afer modifying file config.h, you need to re-make the source code.

```shell
$ make
```

And don't forget to re-[install](#install) again.
